# Argentum Online C++
MMORPG Video Game of the year 1999 created in Visual Basic 6.0 by Pablo Marquez (Morgolock), this game is open source under the "GNU General Public License".  

I have traslated in C++ under SDL2.

# How to compilate
Visual Studio 2019 is needed (although with Code :: blocks, Dev C ++ or any other IDE you can use it, if you know how to build the project).

You must also install and include the SDL2 library along with SDL_Image and SDL_Mixer.
