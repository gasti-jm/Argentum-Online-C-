MMORPG Video Game of the year 1999 created in Visual Basic 6.0 by Pablo Marquez (Morgolock), this game is open source.  

I have translated in C++ under SDL2, this game would be your base client, it would be necessary to implement the multiplayer with your server.

# How to compile
Visual Studio 2019 is needed (although with Code::blocks, DevC++ or any other IDE you can use it, if you know how to build the project).

You must also install and include the SDL2 library along with SDL_Image and SDL_Mixer.

Steps for windows:
